 or 
 A variables just like stored information about data i.e called variables

 Note : in php we assigned or declared any variables $ sign 

 examples :  $a=10;  //integer 
             $b=20.154; // float
             $c="Brijesh kumar Pandey";  //string 
             $d=true;  //boolean



Rules of variables : 
   a) we can't store any variables start with numbers
               $a=10;  //right way
               10$a=20;  //wrong way


    b) we can't start any variables with white space
               $ab;  //right way
               $a b=10; //wrong way 



    c) we can't start any variables with reserved identifier or keyword
               $if=10;  //wrong way
